            Hi! My name is Alex Berrie. I am a programmer from NorthWest Ohio and I've been programming for about 6 years.
            This is my first real website so please excuse
            the sloppiness. The projects displayed here are only from the past 2-3 years, as many of my old ones were lost 
            due to my computer breaking without any of my files being backed up.
            If you want to contact me about
            any projects or questions feel free to visit my
            GitHub page, Handshake account, or check me out on social media.
        </p>
